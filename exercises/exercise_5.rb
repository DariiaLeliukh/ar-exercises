### Exercise 5: Calculations

# 1. Output the total revenue for the entire company (all stores), using Active Record's `.sum` calculation method.
# 2. On the next line, also output the average annual revenue for all stores.
# 3. Output the number of stores that are generating $1M or more in annual sales. **Hint:** Chain together `where` and `size` (or `count`) Active Record methods.

puts "Total revenue #{Store.sum(:annual_revenue)}"
puts "Average revenue #{Store.sum(:annual_revenue)/Store.count}"
puts "Number of stores with revenue over 1M: #{Store.where(annual_revenue: 1000000...).count}"
