# Your code goes here ...

# 1. Load the third store (into `@store3`) as you did the other two before.
# 2. Using Active Record's `destroy` method, delete the store from the database.
# 3. Verify that the store has been deleted by again outputting (`puts`ing) the `count` (as you did in Exercise 1.)

@store3 = Store.find_by(id: 3)
@store3.destroy

# puts "Number of stores in database: #{Store.count}"
